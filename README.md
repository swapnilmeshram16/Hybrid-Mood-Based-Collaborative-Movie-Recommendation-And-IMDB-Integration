# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System with Mood Analysis and IMDb Integration  

## üìå Overview  
This project is a **Mood-Based Movie Recommendation System** that combines **Collaborative Filtering (SVD-based)** with **Mood Analysis** to deliver personalized movie suggestions.  

Most recommendation systems only rely on ratings or user-item history. This project goes one step further by allowing users to provide their **current mood** (e.g., happy, sad, romantic, excited, calm), and then tailoring recommendations accordingly.  

Additionally, it integrates with the **OMDb API** to fetch **IMDb details and posters**, providing not only personalized recommendations but also a visually engaging and informative user experience.

## üéØ Motivation  
In today‚Äôs digital world, users have endless entertainment choices. While traditional recommendation systems are useful, they often fail to consider **human emotions**.  
This project was designed to:  
- Enhance personalization by factoring in **user mood**.  
- Combine **collaborative filtering** with **contextual filtering (mood)**.  
- Provide recommendations that are **accurate, meaningful, and user-friendly**.  
- Bridge the gap between **AI-driven predictions** and **user experience** by integrating IMDb posters and links.
